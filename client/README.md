# Redux Demo

This is our final React activity with internal component state removed for books and replaced with React's Context API.  Adds like buttons for books that are saved in context.  Total likes appear in the Nav bar.  Each book's likes tally is displayed in the "Detail" component jumbotron, if it has likes.
